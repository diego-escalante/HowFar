# HowFar
A little experimental "game" made with Unity.

Made at the beginning of 2016 as an experiment to learn a few new things. There's not much to it, and it is very simple. I used to host it on the web for 10 months, but now that it is no longer anywhere online, I have made the project public here. I hope you find it at least a little interesting.

Cheers!

PS: You'll probably want to change how the current time is set in this [script](https://github.com/diego-escalante/HowFar/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/GameCtrl.cs), otherwise the game will never start.
