# How Far

### [Play How Far here!](http://diego-escalante.github.io/HowFar/)

"A little experimental game." Made with Unity.

Made at the beginning of 2016 as an experiment to learn a few new things. There's not much to it, and it is very simple. I hope you find it at least a little interesting?

Cheers!

PS: If you dive into the project, you'll probably want to change how the current time is set in this [script](https://github.com/diego-escalante/HowFar/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/GameCtrl.cs), otherwise the game will never start.
