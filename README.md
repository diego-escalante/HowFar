## [Play the game here!](https://diego-escalante.itch.io/how-far)
A little experimental game made with Unity in the beginning of 2016 to learn a few new things. Visit this game, and then perhaps set a reminder on your phone?

## Setting Up the Project Locally
1. Make sure you have Unity version 5.6.3p2 installed, as that is the version of the engine that was used for this game. You can get it from the [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).
2. Clone this repo in your desired directory: `git clone https://github.com/diego-escalante/HowFar.git`
3. Start up the Unity Hub. Open the project and ensure that the editor version 5.6.3p2 is selected for the project.
4. One the engine opens up the project, you'll want to change how the current time is set in this [script](https://github.com/diego-escalante/HowFar/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/GameCtrl.cs), otherwise the game will never start.
5. After updating the script, you can run the game by opening up the main scene and pressing the Play button in the top center.
